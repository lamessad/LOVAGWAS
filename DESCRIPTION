Description: This package computes direct genetic effect estimates by adjusting GWAS SNP effect sizes of outcome using the causal effect size of exposures on outcome estimated by robust MVMR approach and marginal SNP effect and its standard error on exposures and outcome the HVP model to disentangle horizontal pleiotropy effects from vertical pleiotropy using GWAS summary data.
